## 👨‍💻 Profile

Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years building production-grade, scalable systems that power critical business operations. I architect infrastructure that makes products work at scale—marketplace matching engines, event-driven microservices, and platform APIs that entire engineering organizations depend on.

**Core expertise:**

- **Backend Architecture**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, C#, .NET Core, event-driven microservices
- **Infrastructure**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis, AWS (Lambda, ECS, S3), Azure, Kubernetes
- **Databases**: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch
- **Platform Engineering**: API design, observability, distributed systems
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, modern JavaScript

I thrive in high-stakes, high-velocity environments where reliability, performance, and maintainability matter. The kind of work where "it just works" is the highest compliment.
