## 👨‍💻 Profile

Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years building production-grade, scalable systems that power critical business operations. I architect infrastructure that makes products work at scale—marketplace matching engines, event-driven microservices, and platform APIs that entire engineering organizations depend on.

**Core expertise:**

- **Backend Architecture**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, PHP, C#, .NET Core, Go, event-driven microservices
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (Lambda, ECS, S3), Kubernetes, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis, Docker
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, SQL Server
- **Quality & Observability**: Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cucumber, Datadog, Prometheus
- **CI/CD & Tooling**: GitHub Actions, Harness
- **Frontend**: React, React Native, Next.js, TypeScript

I thrive in high-stakes, high-velocity environments where reliability, performance, and maintainability matter. The kind of work where "it just works" is the highest compliment.
